#### Summary:
These datasets summarize the sediment geochemistry, water chemistry, and benthic macroinvertebrate community data collected in August 2014 in tributaries exposed to nickel mine effluent from the Birchtree and Thompson mines in Thompson, MB, Canada, to measure nickel bioavailability to the indigenous benthic macroinvertebrate community. Sediment geochemistry was assessed by collecting intact sediment cores in reference and effluent-exposed tributaries, and water chemistry was measured in situ  and in surface water samples of the same tributaries. The data collection was performed in 4 sites in reference tributaries and 10 sites in effluent-exposed tributaries for each mine location (n total = 28 sites). Community data was collected via petite ponar grabs in 10 reference and 10 mine effluent-exposed tributaries (n total = 40). Organisms were sorted and identified to lowest possible taxonomic level (family). Data reported as raw abundances. 

#### Temporal coverage:
Data collection was performed from 6 August 2014 to 8 August 2014. 

#### Geographic coverage:
Field data collection was conducted in Birchtree (55° 41’ N, 97° 57’ W) and Thompson (55° 49’ N, 97° 41’ W) nickel mines in Thompson, MB, Canada. Laboratory analyses and intvertebrate sorting and identification were performed in Cunningham Hall at Kent State University, Kent, OH, USA.

#### Methods and protocols:
Sediment samples were collected as intact sediment cores with plastic tubes and caps in 2 reference (n = 4 sites per tributary) and 2 effluent-exposed tributaries (n = 10 sites per tributary). The core samples were processed and subdivided into surface (0-2 cm) and deep (2-4 cm) samples, placed in whirl-pak bags and frozen (n = 56 samples per mine location, n total = 112). Sediment samples were analyzed for total metals (acid digestion at reflux temperatures), oxidized metals (ascorbate and dithionite selective extractions), acid-volatile sulfide and simultaneously extracted metals (AVS and SEM extraction), carbon and nitrogen content (elemental analyzer), and dry weight to wet weight ratio.\ 
Paired water chemistry was assessed in situ (conductivity, pH) with hand-held YSI sondes at the same sites where sediment samples were obtained. Additionally, filtered and unfiltered surface water samples were taken in 60 ml nalgene bottles to assess the concentration of major anions and dissolved nickel via ion chromatography and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), respectively.\
Benthic macroinvertebrate samples were collected with ponar grabs and sieved through a 500 micron mesh bucket in 10 sites at each reference and effluent-exposed tributaries of Birchtree and Thompson mines. Sieved samples were placed in 8oz. plastic jars filled with 90% ethanol. Organisms were sorted with the aid of a dissecting scope and identified to lowest possible taxonomic level (family). All identified pelagic taxa were excluded from analysis. Abundance data were assessed in terms of taxa relative abundances and used in concentration-response relationships and redundancy analysis (RDA).
